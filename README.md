# Pandemic

A new adventure in putting together a game in python :D

The excel file has all of the cities separated by color with latitude and longitude and with population information.
Population information is suspect because there wasn't a lot of consistency in the numbers I found... some were urban area, some were only city. It's hard to say and honestly it might not even matter.

Michael's Upcoming Tasks:
- Setting up a graph with clickable points that display information
- Review Pygame (whatever the python gaming library is) to see if there's anything useful out there
